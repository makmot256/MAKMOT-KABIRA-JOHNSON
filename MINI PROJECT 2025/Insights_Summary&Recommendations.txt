Summary of Insights and Recommendations
Insights:
Soil pH, moisture, and temperature show the strongest correlation with fertilizer_amount.

The crop with the highest soil moisture (e.g. Rice) tends to require less irrigation but careful fertilization.

Crops grown in environments with >30Â°C typically show reduced soil moisture, indicating the need for targeted irrigation strategies.

Recommendations:
Implement AI-driven irrigation controls for crops in high-temperature zones.

Prioritize monitoring soil pH and moisture for fertilizer efficiency.

For crops like Maize or Wheat in hot climates, adjust irrigation schedules to mitigate heat stress.
